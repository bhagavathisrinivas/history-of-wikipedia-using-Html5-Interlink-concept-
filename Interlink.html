        Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia helping to create a world where everyone can freely share and
        access all available knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and consists of freely editable
        content. The name "Wikipedia" is a blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites,
        from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide
        readers to related pages with more information.

        Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers. Anyone with Internet access and in good
        standing can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted
        to prevent disruption or vandalism.

        Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's largest reference website,
        attracting 1.8 billion unique-device visitors monthly as of April 2022. It currently has more than fifty-eight
        million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,493,105 articles in English with 126,197 active
        contributors in the past month.

        The fundamental principles of Wikipedia are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has
        developed many policies and guidelines, with which familiarity is not a requirement for contributing.

        Anyone is allowed to add or edit words, references, images, and other media here. What is contributed is more
        important than who contributes it. To remain, the content must be free of copyright restrictions and contentious
        material about living people. It must conform with Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable against a
        published reliable source. Editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research will not remain. Contributions
        cannot damage Wikipedia, as its software allows easy reversal of errors, and many experienced editors watch to
        ensure that edits are improvements. Begin by simply clicking the Edit button at the top of any editable page!

        Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is continually created and updated, with
        articles on new events appearing within minutes rather than months or years. Because everyone can help improve
        it, it has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. In addition to the quantity of its articles,
        its contributors work on improving their quality, removing and repairing misinformation and other errors. Over
        time, articles tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. Because anyone can edit them, they may contain
        undetected misinformation, errors or vandalism. Readers who recognize this can obtain valid information (see
        Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia) and fix the articles.

        History


        Further information: History of Wikipedia
        The English edition of Wikipedia has grown to 6,493,105 articles, equivalent to around 3,000 print volumes of
        the Encyclopædia Britannica. Including all language editions, Wikipedia has 58,689,658 articles, equivalent to
        around 22,000 print volumes.[1]
        Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia, a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia, begun
        by the online media company Bomis. Because Nupedia required highly qualified contributors and had an elaborate
        peer review system, its content grew slowly. During 2000, Jimmy Wales, Nupedia's founder and Bomis' cofounder,
        and Larry Sanger, whom Wales had employed for the project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more
        open, complementary project. Multiple sources suggested that a wiki could allow public members to contribute
        material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10, 2001.

        There was considerable resistance from Nupedia's editors and reviewers to associate it with a Wiki-format
        website; so Sanger gave the new project the name "Wikipedia", and it was launched on its own wikipedia.com
        domain on January 15 (now called "Wikipedia Day" by some users). Its server (in San Diego) and bandwidth were
        donated by Wales. Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on Wikipedia include Tim Shell, one of
        Bomis' cofounders and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.

        In May 2001, Wikipedias were launched in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Italian,
        Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish, and were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian versions.
        Polish was added In September,[2] and further commitment to Wikipedia's multilingual provision was made.
        Afrikaans, Norwegian and Serbo-Croatian versions were announced by the end of that year.

        When the Wikimedia Foundation was launched in 2003, Wikipedia's domain was changed to wikipedia.org,
        corresponding with its new parent organization's .org top-level domain denoting its not-for-profit nature. There
        are now Wikipedias in over 300 languages.

        Wikipedia contributors
        Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages the inclusion of a tremendous amount of
        content. About 130,000 people—from expert scholars to casual readers—regularly edit Wikipedia. These experienced
        editors help create a consistent style, following our Manual of Style. Contributors are called "editors" or
        "Wikipedians", regardless of their experience.

        Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members maintain civility while carrying out the important
        work of crafting a high-quality resource. Editors can watch pages, and technically skilled persons can write
        editing programs to track or rectify bad edits. When there are disagreements on content, editors often work
        together to compile articles that fairly represent current expert opinion. Aspiring authors may wish to read
        Contributing to Wikipedia before contributing.

        Although the Wikimedia Foundation owns the site, it is largely uninvolved in Wikipedia's editing or daily
        operation.

        Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which was formed in 2003 to fund
        the two-year old Wikipedia and has since created a family of free-content projects also built and maintained by
        contributing users.

        (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Some text has been imported
        only under CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA-compatible license and cannot be reused under GFDL; such text is identified

        Credits
        Text on Wikipedia is a collaborative work, and the efforts of individual contributors to a page are recorded in
        that page's history, which is publicly viewable. Information on the authorship of images and other media, such
        as sound files, can be found by clicking on the image itself or the nearby information icon to display the file
        page, which includes the author and source, where appropriate, along with other information.

        Wikipedia is available in more than 300 languages, including a Simple English version. Related projects include
        a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, scientific reference sources, a travel guide, a data repository, and a
        news service (see sister projects). Each is maintained and managed by its own community, and often includes
        information that is hard to find elsewhere.

        Basic navigation
        Main page: Help:Navigation
        Wikipedia articles are all cross-referenced. Highlighted text like this means "click here" for in-depth
        information. (Hovering is probably deep enough.) There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for
        other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, navigational templates,
        and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more
        information. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the
        same article in other languages, and further information on our sister projects. Additional links can be easily
        made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.
